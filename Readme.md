# Milkshake

Based on Frappé by [@niftylettuce](https://github.com/niftylettuce)

The reason why I decided to fork [Frappé](https://github.com/niftylettuce/frappe) is simple — I'm a React Native developer, and I'm tired of clicking "Reload JS" or "Debug JS" in React Native context menu manually. 
**Milkshake** allows you to shake Android devices (including emulators), and perform some additional actions automatically, for example, start JS debugging and reload JS.

## Download

If you want to send a donation, please send it to [@niftylettuce](https://github.com/niftylettuce) — he is the developer of original Frappé, and he deserves your money :)
